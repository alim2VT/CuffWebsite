          <p>
            At Cuff, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core
            of the way we design and build the services and products you know
            and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building
            meaningful connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with
            your information and we do not take this lightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not compromise with your privacy. We design all of our
            products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts
            from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product
            design and others to make sure that no decision is taken without
            respect for your privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data. Because
            we use many of the same online services you do, we know that
            insufficient information and overly complicated language are common
            issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we
            have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain
            language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand
            our privacy practices!
          </p>
          <p>
            We work hard to keep your information secure We have teams dedicated
            to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our
            security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the
            safety of your information.

          <p>
            Welcome to Cuff’s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to
            read it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend
            to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you
            understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is
            used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy
            describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and
            technical jargon to a minimum.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies beginning May 25, 2018. The previous
            version of this Privacy Policy, available here, will apply until
            then.

        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
          <p>
            If you live outside the European Union, the company responsible for
            your information is Cuff.

          <h3>2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other
            services operated by Cuff. For simplicity, we refer to all of these
            as our &ldquo;services&rdquo; in this Privacy Policy. To make it
            extra clear, we&rsquo;ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all
            applicable services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a
            particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy --
            not this Privacy Policy -- applies.

          <h3>3. Information We Collect</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
          <p>
            It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful
            connections without some information about you, such as basic
            profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also
            collect information generated as you use our services, for example
            access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when
            you access our services through a social media account. If you want
            additional info, we go into more detail below.

          <h3>4. Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
          <p>
            We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies
            (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s).
            You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use
            them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and
            settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and
            measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you
            to use social features) and how you can better control their use,
            through your browser settings and other tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and
            Chrome) have a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;)
            feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his
            or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT
            signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website
            from collecting certain information about the browser&rsquo;s user.
            Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet
            uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Cuff, do not
            currently respond to DNT signals.

              Provide our service to you: Most of the time, the reason we

          <h3>6. How We Share Information</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
          <p>
            Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main
            sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. We
            also share some users’ information with service providers and
            partners who assist us in operating the services in some cases,
            legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your
            information is shared with others.
          </p>
          <h4>With other users</h4>
          <p>
            You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose
            information on the service (including your public profile). Please
            be careful with your information and make sure that the content you
            share is stuff that you&rsquo;re comfortable being publically
            viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with
            your information once you share it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile
            or for certain content or information about you, then it will be
            visible according to your settings.
          </p>
          <h4>With our service providers and partners</h4>
          <p>
            We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services.
            These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data
            hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing,
            advertising, payment processing and security operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also share information with partners who distribute and
            assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share
            limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to
            advertising partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service
            provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers
            and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.
          </p>
          <h4>For corporate transactions</h4>
          <p>
            We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in
            whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture,
            restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other
            change of ownership or control.
          </p>
          <h4>When required by law</h4>
          <p>
            We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to
            comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or
            search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other
            legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of
            crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect
            the safety of any person.
          </p>
          <h4>To enforce legal rights</h4>
          <p>
            We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our
            liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to
            protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business
            partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our
            agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other
            action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other
            wrongdoing.
          </p>
          <h4>With your consent or at your request</h4>
          <p>
            We may ask for your consent to share your information with third
            parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to
            share the information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information
            that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device
            information, general demographics, general behavioral data,
            geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information
            in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above
            circumstances. We may also share this information third parties
            (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on
            our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and
            to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this
            information with additional non-personal information or personal
            information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other
            sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar
            technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy

        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
          <p>
            Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves
            cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of
            America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service
            allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area
            (“EEA”), their personal information is transferred to countries
            outside of the EEA. We use standard contract clauses approved by the
            European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data
            transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard contractual
            clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal
            data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data

          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you
              the right to review the personal information we keep about you
              (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of
              access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You
              can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such
              a request here.
            </li>

              Updating your information. If you believe that the information we
              hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to
              use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object
              to its processing, please contact us here.

            For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may
            ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
            requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including
            if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or
            intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to
            receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any
            messages you received from him or her through our service, the other
            user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their
            written consent before the information is released.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object
            to the processing of personal information, notably where such
            requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.
            For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your
            date of birth.

          <p>
            We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or
            alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information.
            As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure
            your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that
            your personal information will always remain secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and
            attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and
            processing practices to update our physical, technical and
            organizational security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without
            notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you
            believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please
            notify us immediately here

          <h3>11. How Long We Retain Your Information</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="subtext">
          <p>
            We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for
            legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as
            permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of
            our users on and off our services, we implement a safety retention
            window of three months following account deletion. During this
            period, account information will be retained although the account
            will of course not be visible on the services anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion
            of your account (following the safety retention window) or after two
            years of continuous inactivity, unless:
          </p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li>
              we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some
              “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data
              retention obligations);
            </li>
            <li>
              we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law
              (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy
              and other similar consents are kept for five years);
            </li>
            <li>
              there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to
              keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or
            </li>
            <li>
              the information must be kept for our legitimate business
              interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety
              and security. For example, information may need to be kept to
              prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security
              incidents from opening a new account.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out
            data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot
            promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe
            due to technical constraints.
