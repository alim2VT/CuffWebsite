          materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you
          with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service
          entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless
          extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns,
          prevent us from doing so.

        <h3>7. Rights you Grant Cuff:</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="subtext">
        <p>
          By creating an account, you grant to Cuff a worldwide, transferable,
          sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host, store, use,
          copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute
          information you authorize us to access from Apple, as well as any
          information you post, upload, display or otherwise make available
          (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to other users
          (collectively, “Content”). Cuff’s license to your Content shall be
          non-exclusive, except that Cuff’s license shall be exclusive with
          respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For
          example, Cuff would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the
          Service that include your Content. In addition, so that Cuff can
          prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize
          Cuff to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your
          Content taken from the Service by other users or third parties. This
          expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send
          notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown
          Notices) on your behalf if your Content is taken and used by third
          parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject
          to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding
          personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal
          information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose
          of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and
          researching and developing new ones. You agree that any Content you
          place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed
          by other users and may be viewed by any person visiting or
          participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive
          shared Content from other Cuff users).
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your
          account, including information submitted from your Apple ID, is
          accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on
          the Service and grant the license to Cuff above.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you
          post as part of a Service. We may delete any Content, in whole or in
          part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm
          the reputation of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree
          to be courteous. If we feel that your behavior towards any
          of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time
          threatening or offensive, we reserve the right to terminate your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          In consideration for Cuff allowing you to use the Service, you agree
          that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place
          advertising on the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to
          Cuff regarding our Service, you agree that Cuff may use and share such
