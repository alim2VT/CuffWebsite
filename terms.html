        <p>
          By creating a Cuff account or by using any Cuff service, whether
          through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively,
          the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii)
          our Privacy Policy and Safety Tips , each of which is incorporated by
          reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed to you if
          you purchase or have purchased additional features, products or
          services we offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If
          you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this
          Agreement (other than the limited one-time opt out right for certain
          users provided for in Section 15), you should not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to
          time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect
          changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in
          business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be
          posted on the Service under Settings and also on goCuff.com, and you
          should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent
          version is the version that applies. If the changes include material
          changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in
          advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include
          notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use
          the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the
          revised Agreement. You agree that this Agreement shall supersede any
          prior agreements (except as specifically stated herein), and shall
          govern your entire relationship with Cuff, including but not limited
          to events, agreements, and conduct preceding your acceptance of this

          Cuff is always striving to improve the Service and bring you
          additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This
          means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to

          materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you
          with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service
          entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless
          extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns,
          prevent us from doing so.

        <p>
          You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by
          following the instructions in “Settings” in the Service,

          account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the

        <p>
          By creating an account, you grant to Cuff a worldwide, transferable,
          sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host, store, use,
          copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute
          information you authorize us to access from Apple, as well as any
          information you post, upload, display or otherwise make available
          (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to other users
          (collectively, “Content”). Cuff’s license to your Content shall be
          non-exclusive, except that Cuff’s license shall be exclusive with
          respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For
          example, Cuff would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the
          Service that include your Content. In addition, so that Cuff can
          prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize
          Cuff to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your
          Content taken from the Service by other users or third parties. This
          expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send
          notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown
          Notices) on your behalf if your Content is taken and used by third
          parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject
          to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding
          personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal
          information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose
          of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and
          researching and developing new ones. You agree that any Content you
          place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed
          by other users and may be viewed by any person visiting or
          participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive
          shared Content from other Cuff users).
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your
          account, including information submitted from your Apple ID, is
          accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on
          the Service and grant the license to Cuff above.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you
          post as part of a Service. We may delete any Content, in whole or in
          part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm
          the reputation of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree

          threatening or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately
          terminate your account.

        <p>
          In consideration for Cuff allowing you to use the Service, you agree
          that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place
          advertising on the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to
          Cuff regarding our Service, you agree that Cuff may use and share such
          feedback for any purpose without compensating you.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that Cuff may access, preserve and disclose your account
          information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith
          belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably
          necessary, such as to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce
          this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the
          rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer
          service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the
          Company or any other person.
