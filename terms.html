        <p>
          By creating a Cuff account or by using any Cuff service, whether
          through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively,
          the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii)
          our Privacy Policy and Safety Tips , each of which is incorporated by
          reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed to you if
          you purchase or have purchased additional features, products or
          services we offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If
          you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this
          Agreement (other than the limited one-time opt out right for certain
          users provided for in Section 15), you should not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to
          time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect
          changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in
          business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be
          posted on the Service under Settings and also on goCuff.com, and you
          should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent
          version is the version that applies. If the changes include material
          changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in
          advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include
          notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use
          the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the
          revised Agreement. You agree that this Agreement shall supersede any
          prior agreements (except as specifically stated herein), and shall
          govern your entire relationship with Cuff, including but not limited
          to events, agreements, and conduct preceding your acceptance of this

        <p>
          Cuff is always striving to improve the Service and bring you
          additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This
          means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to
          time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not
          materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you
          with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service
          entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless
          extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns,
          prevent us from doing so.

        <p>
          You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by
          following the instructions in “Settings” in the Service,

          Cuff may terminate your account at any time without notice if it
          believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination,
          you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your
          account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the
          following provisions will still apply to you and Cuff: Section 4,

          Though Cuff strives to encourage a respectful user experience through
          features like the double opt-in that only allows users to communicate

        <p>
          By creating an account, you grant to Cuff a worldwide, transferable,
          sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host, store, use,
          copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute
          information you authorize us to access from Apple, as well as any
          information you post, upload, display or otherwise make available
          (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to other users
          (collectively, “Content”). Cuff’s license to your Content shall be
          non-exclusive, except that Cuff’s license shall be exclusive with
          respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For
          example, Cuff would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the
          Service that include your Content. In addition, so that Cuff can
          prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize
          Cuff to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your
          Content taken from the Service by other users or third parties. This
          expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send
          notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown
          Notices) on your behalf if your Content is taken and used by third
          parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject
          to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding
          personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal
          information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose
          of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and
          researching and developing new ones. You agree that any Content you
          place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed
          by other users and may be viewed by any person visiting or
          participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive
          shared Content from other Cuff users).
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your
          account, including information submitted from your Apple ID, is
          accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on
          the Service and grant the license to Cuff above.

        <p>
          You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you
          post as part of a Service. We may delete any Content, in whole or in
          part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm
          the reputation of the Service.

          You agree that Cuff may access, preserve and disclose your account
          information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith
          belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably
          necessary, such as to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce

          equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you
          do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want
          to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to
          your third party account (or Account Settings on Cuff) and follow
          instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise
          deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Cuff
          application from your device. Deleting your account on Cuff or
          deleting the Cuff application from your device does not cancel your
          subscription; Cuff will retain all funds charged to your Payment
          Method until you cancel your subscription on Cuff or the third party
          account, as applicable. If you cancel your subscription, you may use
          your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription
          term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your
          then-current term expires.

            >Additional Terms that apply if you pay Cuff directly with your
            Payment Method.</b
          >
          If you pay Cuff directly, Cuff may correct any billing errors or
          mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received
          payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment
          made with your Payment Method, Cuff may terminate your account
          immediately in its sole discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting Cuff and
          going to “My Profile.” If a payment is not successfully settled, due
          to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit
          your Payment Method information or cancel your subscription, you
          remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to
          continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may
          result in a change to your payment billing dates. In addition, you
          authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and
          card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit
          or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your
          Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the
          financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your
          chosen Payment Method. If you reside outside of the Americas, you
          agree that your payment to Cuff will be through MTCH Technology
          Services Limited.

          <b>Cuff Rating and Other Virtual Items.</b> From time to time, you may
          be able to purchase, a limited, personal, non-transferable,
          non-sublicensable, revocable license to use “virtual items,” including
          but not limited to Cuff Rating (collectively, “Virtual Items”). Any
          Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a
          real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead
          constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Virtual Items
          do not incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in
          Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this
          Agreement, when Cuff ceases providing the Service or your account is
          otherwise closed or terminated. Cuff, in its sole discretion, reserves
          the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items
          and/ or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. Cuff may
          manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any
          time. Cuff shall have no liability to you or any third party in the
          event that Cuff exercises any such rights. Virtual Items may only be
          redeemed through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL
          ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The
          provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service that
          commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such
          Virtual Items. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Cuff IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A
          REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER
          COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED,
          WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Refunds.</b> Generally, all charges for purchases are
          nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used
          periods. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription
          offering is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or
          if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.

          You may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, at
          any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the
          date you subscribed. In the event that you die before the end of your
          subscription period, your estate shall be entitled to a refund of that
          portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is
          allocable to the period after your death. In the event that you become
          disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of Cuff) before
          the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund
          of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription
          which is allocable to the period after your disability by providing
          the company notice in the same manner as you request a refund as

        <p>Except where prohibited by applicable law:</p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>
            The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of
            or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach

            ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association
            under the Consumer Arbitration Rules. The one exception to the
            exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an
            individual claim against Cuff in a small claims court of competent
            jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, or in Dallas County,
            Texas. Such arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions
            only, unless either you or Cuff elect to invoke the right to an oral
            hearing before the Arbitrator. But whether you choose arbitration or
            small claims court, you agree that you will not under any
            circumstances commence, maintain, or participate in any class
            action, class arbitration, or other representative action or
            proceeding against Cuff.
          </li>
          <li>
            By accepting this Agreement, you agree to the Arbitration Agreement
            in this Section 15 (subject to the limited one-time right to opt out
            within thirty (30) days belonging to users who first created an
            account or used the Service prior to May 9, 2018 (such users,
            “Legacy Users”), discussed below). In doing so, BOTH YOU AND Cuff
            GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims
            between you and Cuff (except for matters that may be properly taken
            to a small claims court and are within such court’s jurisdiction).
            YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR
            OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING, including, without limitation, any past,
            pending or future class actions, including those existing as of the
            date of this Agreement, which include without limitation: Allan
            Candelore v. Cuff, Inc., Los Angeles Superior Court, State of
            California, County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC583162 (generally
            claiming, on behalf of California citizens who subscribed to Cuff
            Plus when they were at least 30 years old that Cuff violated the
            California Unruh Civil Rights Act by charging older subscribers a
            higher price than Cuff charged subscribers younger than 30) and Kim
            v. Cuff, Inc., United States District Court, Central District of
            California, Case No. 2:18-cv-03093 generally claiming, on behalf of
            California citizens who subscribed to Cuff Plus when they were at
            least 30 years old that Cuff violated the California Unruh Civil
            Rights Act by charging older subscribers a higher price than Cuff
            charged subscribers younger than 30). This list may not be
            exhaustive, and there may be other currently pending actions against
            Cuff.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you assert a claim against Cuff outside of small claims court,
            your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE
            OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all
            issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. The same is true
            for Cuff. Both you and Cuff are entitled to a fair hearing before
            the arbitrator. The arbitrator can generally grant the relief that a
            court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are
            usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial
            proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court
            and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For
            details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures .
          </li>
          <li>
            The Jurisdiction and Venue provisions in Sections 16 and 17 are
            incorporated and are applicable to this Arbitration Agreement.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As you decide whether to agree to this Arbitration Agreement, here are
          some important considerations:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not
            involve the civil courts, a civil judge or a jury. Instead, the
            parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the
            parties under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American
            Arbitration Association. Arbitration does not limit or affect the
            legal claims you as an individual may bring against Cuff. Agreeing
            to arbitration will only affect where those claims may be brought
            and how they will be resolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute
            resolution process than the judicial system, but that is not always
            the case. The Arbitrator will typically determine whether Cuff or
            you will be required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration
            with Cuff, based on the circumstances presented.
          </li>
          <li>
            IMPORTANT: THERE ARE NOW, AND MAY BE IN THE FUTURE, LAWSUITS AGAINST
            Cuff ALLEGING CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF
            INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION
            15, WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL, COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN SOME MONETARY
            OR OTHER RECOVERY TO YOU, IF YOU ELECT TO OPT OUT OF THE RETROACTIVE
            APPLICATION OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THE MERE EXISTENCE OF
            SUCH CLASS AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUITS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT MEAN
            THAT SUCH LAWSUITS WILL ULTIMATELY SUCCEED, OR, EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL,
            THAT YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO ANY RECOVERY.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be precluded from bringing any class or representative
            action against Cuff, unless you timely opt out of the retroactive
            application of this Arbitration Agreement, and you will also be
            precluded from participating in any recovery resulting from any
            class or representative action brought against Cuff, in each case
            provided you are not already bound by an arbitration agreement and
            class action waiver previously agreed to with Cuff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under Rule R-9 of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, either party
            to an arbitration involving a claim within the jurisdiction of a
            small claims court may choose to have the case decided by the small
            claims court instead. Please review Rule R-9 for more details.
            Nothing in this Agreement, including the right of the consumer (but
            not Cuff) to file a dispute directly in small claims court rather
            than initiating arbitration, should be construed as being
            inconsistent with either party’s right to invoke Rule R-9 after an
            arbitration has been initiated.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          WHETHER TO AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS AN IMPORTANT
          DECISION. IT IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, AND YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE TO
          CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS — INCLUDING BUT
          NOT LIMITED TO AN ATTORNEY — REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR
          DECISION, JUST AS YOU WOULD WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS
          OR LIFE DECISION.
